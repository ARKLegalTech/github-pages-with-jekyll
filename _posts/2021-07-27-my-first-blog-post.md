Here are some topics I plan to cover soon:

(1) Evidentiary considerations for developers

(2) Electronic medical records requests

(3) FOIA requests for electronically stored information

(4) Criminal justice reform: the ESI Protocol vs. the EDRM

(5) Using relational database principles to build a better court system.

Please contact me if there's a legal tech topic you'd like to see covered!
